##Loaderlet v0.1
===

Loaderlet is a simple(and messy) javascript library loader for develop/test use.

You can use it either by putting it into bookmark bar

[Loaderlet]()
or calling the function, 

```
lodrlt();
```

Then, put the number of the library you want to use on the prompt and that's it.

Should work nice on Webkit browsers, not sure about others though.
